3.  INSTALLATION

    You have probably already unpacked the TAR file. The next step is
    to decide whether you want to install the package system-wide or
    to keep it where you unpacked it.

    If you want to install it system-wide, do the following within the
    tarball directory:

      make install prefix=/usr/local

    where you can set the prefix to anything as long as it is an
    absolute path.  After this, ensure your PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set to
    include the libspotify control file, and that the lib directory is
    in the library search path.  Now you are set to go!


4.  APPLICATION KEYS

    The example programs require a file called appkey.c which is not
    present in the package.  You will need to request an application
    key at the developer website at http://developer.spotify.com/
    before being able to run them.


5.  EXAMPLES

    To quickly compile and run the examples directly from the unpacked
    tar archive (without having to install the library anywhere) just
    do:

      cd share/doc/libspotify/examples
      make LIBSPOTIFY_PATH=../../../..

    Note that you need to have ALSA's dev package installed
    (libasound2-dev) to compile the jukebox example and readline dev
    package (libreadline-dev) to build the spshell example.

    To run the spshell example just do:

      spshell/spshell

    Note that the example makefiles will try to find libspotify via
    pkg-config(1) if LIBSPOTIFY_PATH is not provided as argument.


5.  LOGOTYPES AND TRADEMARK

    The graphics found in the images/ subdirectory are available for
    use in applications using libspotify. The terms and conditions for
    the use of these are available on http://developer.spotify.com/.

    A text file is included in images/, containing the text to be used
    in non-graphical applications.


6.  LICENSE

    You should have received a separate LICENSE file together with
    this README.
