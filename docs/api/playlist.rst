Playlists
*********

The :class:`Playlist` class
===========================
.. currentmodule:: spotify

:class:`Playlist` objects are iterable: they are a list of :class:`Track`
objects.

.. class:: Playlist

    Playlist objects.

    .. method:: add_tracks(position, tracks)

        :param position:    where to add the tracks in the playlist
        :type position:     :class:`int`
        :param tracks:      tracks to add to the playlist
        :type tracks:       list of :class:`Track`

    .. method:: add_tracks_added_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p, list of
            :class:`Track` tracks, :class:`int` position,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_tracks_moved_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p, list of
            :class:`Track` tracks, :class:`int` new_position,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_tracks_removed_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p, list of
            :class:`Track` tracks, :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_playlist_renamed_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_playlist_state_changed_callback(callback[, \
        userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback


        Called when state changed for a playlist.

        There are three states that trigger this callback:

        - Collaboration for this playlist has been turned on or off
        - The playlist started having pending changes, or all pending
            changes have now been committed
        - The playlist started loading, or finished loading


    .. method:: add_playlist_update_in_progress_callback(callback[, \
        userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`bool` done, :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

        Called when a playlist is updating or is done updating.

        This is called before and after a series of changes are applied to the
        playlist. It allows e.g. the user interface to defer updating until the
        entire operation is complete.

    .. method:: add_playlist_metadata_updated_callback(callback[, \
        userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_track_created_changed_callback(callback[, \
        userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`int` position, :class:`User` user, :class:`int` when,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

        *user* is the new user information and *when* is a time in seconds
        since the UNIX Epoch.

    .. method:: add_track_message_changed_callback(callback[, \
        userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`int` position, :class:`unicode` message,
            :class:`Object` userdata)

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`int` position, :class:`bool` seen,
            :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_description_changed_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`unicode` description, :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_subscribers_changed_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,

        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: add_image_changed_callback(callback[, userdata])

        :param callback:    signature: (:class:`Playlist` p,
            :class:`str` image_id, :class:`Object` userdata)
        :param userdata:    any object you would like to access in the callback

    .. method:: is_collaborative

        :rtype:     :class:`int`
        :returns:   collaborative status for a playlist.

        .. note:: A playlist in collaborative state can be modifed by all
            users, not only the user owning the list.

    .. method:: is_loaded

        :rtype:     :class:`int`
        :returns:   whether this playlist has been loaded by the client

    .. method:: name

        :rtype:     string
        :returns:   the name of the playlist.

    .. method:: num_subscribers

        :rtype:     :class:`int`
        :returns:   The number of subscribers of this playlist

    .. method:: owner

        :rtype:     :class:`spotify.User`
        :returns:   the owner of the playlist

    .. method:: rename(name)

        :param name:    the new name
        :type name:     :class:`unicode`

    .. method:: remove_callback(callback[, userdata])

        Removes the corresponding callback, userdata couple.

    .. method:: remove_tracks(tracks)

        :param tracks:  A list of track positions to be removed from the playlist.
        :type tracks:   list of :class:`int`

    .. method:: subscribers

        :rtype:     list of :class:`unicode`
        :returns:   a list of canonical names of subscribers of this playlist.

        .. note:: The count returned for this function may be less than those
            returned by :meth:`num_subscribers`. Spotify does not track each
            user subscribed to a playlist for playlist with many (>500)
            subscribers.

    .. method:: track_create_time(index)

        :param index:   index of the track in the playlist
        :type index:    :class:`int`
        :rtype:         :class:`int`
        :returns:       number of seconds after Unix epoch the track was
                        added to the playlist

    .. method:: type

        returns ``'playlist'``

    .. method:: update_subscribers

        Ask library to update the subscription count for a playlist.

        When the subscription info has been fetched from the Spotify backend
        the :meth:`manager.SpotifyPlaylistManager.subscribers_changed`
        callback will be invoked. In that callback use
        :meth:`num_subscribers` and/or :meth:`subscribers` to get information
        about the subscribers. You
        can call those two functions anytime you want but the information might
        not be up to date in such cases

The :class:`PlaylistFolder` class

    boundaries).

        returns 0.

    .. method:: is_loaded

        returns ``True`` when the container it belongs to is loaded.

    .. method:: name

        if type is ``'folder_start'``, returns the name of the folder, else
        returns an empty string.

    .. method:: type
