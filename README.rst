pyspotify provides a Python interface to
`Spotify's <http://www.spotify.com/>`__ online music streaming service.

With pyspotify you can access music metadata, search in Spotify's library of
20+ million tracks, manage your Spotify playlists, and play music from
Spotify. All from your own Python applications.

pyspotify use CFFI to make a pure Python wrapper around the official
`libspotify <https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/>`__
library. It works on CPython 2.7 and 3.2+, as well as PyPy 2.1+. It is known
to work on Linux and OS X. Windows support should be possible, but is awaiting
a contributor with the interest and knowledge to maintain it.
