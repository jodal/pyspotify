      Several fantastic pieces of <a href = "http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> and <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open-source</a> software have really helped get <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> to where it is today. A few require that we include their license agreements within our product. Consider it done. As we enjoy giving credit where it's due, we included the entire list below. This means you can not only see which software we've been using, but the terms of the licenses too. A big thanks from all of us at Spotify to the smart people behind the fantastic programs listed. Rock on!
