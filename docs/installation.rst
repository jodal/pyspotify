Since pyspotify is a Python wrapper around the libspotify library, pyspotify
necessarily depends on libspotify.


Installing libspotify
=====================

libspotify is provided as a binary download for a selection of operating
systems and CPU architectures from the `libspotify site
<https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/>`__. If libspotify
isn't available for your OS or architecture, then you're out of luck and can't
use pyspotify either.

To install libspotify, use one of the options below, or follow the instructions
on the libspotify site and in the README file of the libspotify tarball.


Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian
----------------------

If you're running a Debian-based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu or Raspbian,
you can get Debian packages of libspotify from `apt.mopidy.com
<https://apt.mopidy.com/>`__. Follow the instructions on the site to add
apt.mopidy.com as a software repository on your system. In summary::

    wget -q -O - https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.list
    sudo apt-get update

Then install libspotify::

    sudo apt-get install libspotify-dev


Arch Linux
----------

libspotify is packaged in `AUR
<https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libspotify/>`_. To install libspotify,
run::

    yaourt -S libspotify


Fedora
------

libspotify is packaged in `rpmfusion non-free <http://rpmfusion.org/>`_.
Install the repository package, then run::

    yum -y install libspotify-devel


Mac OS X
--------

If you're using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_, it has a formula for
libspotify in the homebrew/binary tap::

    brew install homebrew/binary/libspotify

Install libffi as a dependency::

    brew install libffi

.. warning::

   There's an issue with building pyspotify against libspotify on OS X where
   the pyspotify installation fails with "Reason: image not found".

   A known workaround is to create a symlink after installing libspotify, but
   before installing pyspotify::

       ln -s /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify.12.1.51.dylib \
       /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify

   Alternatively, the mopidy/mopidy Homebrew tap has a libspotify formula which
   includes the workaround::

       brew install mopidy/mopidy/libspotify

   For details, or if you have a proper fix for this, see :issue:`130`.

TODO: Check if pyspotify works with the Mac OS X download option from the
libspotify web site.


Installing pyspotify
====================

You can install pyspotify from PyPI. PyPI may have a pyspotify package
precompiled for your OS and architecture available as a wheel package. To
install it run::

    pip install --pre pyspotify

.. note::

    The ``--pre`` argument to ``pip install`` is needed to make pip 1.4 or
    newer install pre-releases, like the alpha and beta releases of pyspotify
    2.x.

If this fails, then pyspotify probably isn't available prebuilt for your OS and
architecture. In that case, you'll need a C compiler, Python development
headers, and libffi development headers to build pyspotify. When you got that
in place, you can rerun the ``pip`` command to install pyspotify.

Once you have pyspotify installed, you should head over to :doc:`quickstart`
for a short introduction to pyspotify.


Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian
----------------------

If you're on a Debian-based system, you can install the pyspotify build
dependencies by running::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python3-dev libffi-dev


Arch Linux
----------

If you're on Arch Linux, you can install the pyspotify build dependencies by
running::

    sudo pacman -S base-devel python2 python


Mac OS X
--------

If you're on Mac OS X, you'll need to install the Xcode command line developer
tools. Even if you've already installed Xcode from the App Store, e.g. to get
Homebrew working, you should run this command::

    xcode-select --install

If you get an error about ``ffi.h`` not being found when installing the cffi
Python package, try running the above command.

.. warning::

    Due to a currently unresolved issue, the CFFI-generated C extension module
    in pyspotify is linked with libspotify without the ``.dylib`` file suffix.

    If ``pip install --pre pyspotify`` fails with the message "Reason: image
    not found", then run the following command and rerun the pip command::

        ln -s /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify.dylib \
            /usr/local/opt/libspotify/lib/libspotify

    If you know how to permanently fix this, please comment on :issue:`130`.
