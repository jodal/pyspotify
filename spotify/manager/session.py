    Client for Spotify. Inherit from this class to have your callbacks
    called on the appropriate events.

    Exceptions raised in your callback handlers will be displayed on the
    standard error output (stderr).

    When logging in a user, the application can pass one of:
        - `username` + `password`: standard login using a plaintext password
        - nothing: logs in the last user which credentials have been stored
          using `remember_me`.
        - `username` + `login_blob`: the blob is encrypted data from
          *libspotify*, for when a multi-user application wants to use
          the re-login feature. The blob is obtained from the
          :meth:`credentials_blob_updated` callback after a successful
          login to the Spotify AP.

    When behind a proxy, the application can specify:
        - `proxy`: url to the proxy server that should be used. The format
            is ``protocol://<host>:port`` (where protocol is
            ``http/https/socks4/socks5``)
        - `proxy_username`: username to authenticate with the proxy server.
        - `proxy_password`: password to authenticate with the proxy server.
